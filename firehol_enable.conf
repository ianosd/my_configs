# The above 2 interfaces were found active at this moment.
# Add more interfaces that can potentially be activated in the future.
# FireHOL will not complain if you setup a firewall on an interface that is
# not active when you activate the firewall.
# If you don't setup an interface, FireHOL will drop all traffic from or to
# this interface, if and when it becomes available.
# Also, if an interface name dynamically changes (i.e. ppp0 may become ppp1)
# you can use the plus (+) character to match all of them (i.e. ppp+).



# No router statements have been produced, because your server
# is not configured for forwarding traffic.
